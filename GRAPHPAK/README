IMPORTANT NOTE: If any of your graphs display a legend, it may be necessary
to compile the SUPPORT.BAS module with either /d or /x.  This fixes a bug in
QuickBASIC that causes the legend to be displayed improperly (if at all).


               The following changes and additions have
               added to Graphpak Professional version 3.7
               ******************************************

1. Specifying a Y axis heading other than "PERCENT" now no longer
requires a source code modification.  The variable YHeading$ has been
added for this purpose and is declared as COMMON SHARED in COMMON.BAS.
The default heading is still "PERCENT", but it may be changed at any
time before the call to any of the graph routines by assigning a new
string to YHeading$. This change affects COMMON.BAS, SETGPDAT.BAS and
SUPPORT.BAS.


2. RealTime is a new routine that will graph data passed to it in real
time. RealTime is a BASIC subroutine contained in REALTIME.BAS


   Purpose:

   RealTime is a multiple line graphing subroutine that will plot data
in real time.  It is meant to be called in a loop where each iteration
passes new data to be plotted.  RealTime can produce a dynamic plot
similar to an oscilloscope display.

   Syntax:

   CALL RealTime (GraphData!(), XTitle$(), YTitle$, MainTitle$,_
                  Colors(), Action%

   Where:

   GraphData!() is a one dimensional array containing the current
point(s) to be plotted.  It should be dimensioned to the number of lines
being plotted.  Data for line 1 goes into GraphData!(1), data for line 2
goes into GraphData!(2), etc.  Each time through the loop GraphData!()
is to be updated with new data to be plotted.

   XTitle$() is a one dimensional string array containing the titles to
be displayed on the X axis. The array should be dimensioned to one
element larger than the number of points being plotted to accommodate
the X axis heading.

   YTitle$() is a one dimensional string array containing the titles to
be displayed in the line legend.  The array should be dimensioned to one
element larger than the number of lines being plotted to accommodate the
legend heading.

   MainTitle$ is the title to be displayed at the top of the graph.

   Colors() is an array of colors to use when plotting lines.  This
array can be dimensioned to any number up to the maximum number of
colors available for the current screen mode.  (GPDat(50) contains the
maximum number of colors available for the current screen mode.)
Colors(1) is the color to use for the first line, Colors(2) is the color
to use for the second line etc..  If you specify a Colors array of a
smaller size than the number of lines being plotted, GraphPak will loop
through the Colors array to obtain the additional colors.  Duplicated
colors will be displayed with a different line type, i.e., dotted,
dashed, etc..  See Appendix E in the
   GraphPak Professional manual for more information on the Colors()
array.

   Action is a special variable that determines how RealTime will
behave. When set to 0, -1 or -2, RealTime displays the graph background,
axis, X and Y titles, main title, line legend (if any) and exits the
routine without plotting any data, but first resets Action to 2.  Action
values of -1 and -2 are used to determine how RealTime will behave when
called in retrace mode.  Action set to -1 causes the entire graph region
to be  cleared between each retrace.  Action set to -2 only clears the
region just ahead of where the data is being plotted.  This leaves the
previous graph on the screen until it is over written by the new plot.
This process is somewhat more complicated then the one used with Action
-1 and is therefore a bit slower.

   After calling RealTime with Action 0, -1, or -2, Action is reset to 2
to allow data to be plotted the next time RealTime is called.  With
action set to 2, RealTime will begin to plot the data passed in the
GraphData!() array and sets Action to 3 to continue plotting. If you do
not need the retrace feature and only want to plot one complete pass,
you can start with Action set to either 0, or -1.  Simply place a
counter variable in your loop and exit when Count = number of points +
1.

Comments:
   RealTime always uses the entire graph region to plot data, therefore
GPDat(21) has no effect.  Tiling of the graph background is disabled when
starting RealTime with Action set to -1 or -2.  If more than 6 lines are
plotted, no line legend will be displayed.

   Unlike the other graphs contained in GraphPak Professional, the graph
height and width is automatically adjusted to the exact size required to
contain the plot.  In some instances this will cause the graph to be
smaller than specified in GPDat(39) and GPDat(40) but produces a more
attractive plot.
